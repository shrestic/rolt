## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Open in VSCode Dev Container

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rolt
```

- Server Django s·∫Ω t·ª± ƒë·ªông ƒë∆∞·ª£c kh·ªüi ch·∫°y b√™n trong container

### 2. Migrate & Seed Database

M·ªü terminal trong Dev Container v√† ch·∫°y:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py init_roles
```

Manually execute SQL to mock product data:

```bash
psql -U <your_db_user> -d <your_db_name> -f seed.sql
```

### 3. Start WebSocket Chat Locally (with token)

```bash
wscat -c "ws://www.rolt.cloud/ws/chat/support-phong-issue-001/?token=<your-token>"
```

Example:
```json
> {"message":"Hello"}
< {"type": "chat_message", "message": "Hello", "user": "davidmiller"}
< {"message": "Connection closed due to inactivity.", "user": "system"}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Options

This project supports two primary deployment methods:

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Quick Deployment via Heroku

#### Step 1: Merge Production `.env` Files

Use the following script to merge all required `.env` variables into one file:

```bash
python merge_production_dotenvs_in_dotenv.py
```

This will create a unified `.env` file for production use.

---

#### Step 2: Set Config Vars on Heroku

Check the `.example.env` file to view all required environment variables. You can:

* Set them manually via Heroku Dashboard, or
* Use the [Heroku Config CLI Plugin](https://github.com/xavdid/heroku-config) for bulk upload.

---

#### Step 3: VNPAY Integration (Optional)

If you're using VNPAY for payments:

* The integration runs in **sandbox mode** but is **production-ready**.
* Register a sandbox account at the official site by searching:
  üëâ **"VNPAY ƒëƒÉng k√Ω t√†i kho·∫£n sandbox"**
* Use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to test IPN callbacks locally.
* Configure the IPN URL after login here:
  üëâ [https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/merchantv2/Users/Login.htm?ReturnUrl=%2fmerchantv2%2fAccount%2fTerminalEdit.htm](https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/merchantv2/Users/Login.htm?ReturnUrl=%2fmerchantv2%2fAccount%2fTerminalEdit.htm)
* Real production integration requires official merchant approval from VNPAY.

---

### üß± Option 2: Production Deployment via AWS & Terraform

This project includes full Infrastructure as Code (IaC) support using **Terraform** to provision and deploy on AWS.

#### üîß Infrastructure Components:

* **ECS Fargate** for container orchestration
* **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** for traffic routing
* **RDS (PostgreSQL)** for managed relational database
* **Elasticache (Redis)** for caching and Celery task queues
* **S3** for static/media file storage
* **CloudWatch Logs** for centralized log management
* **VPC with public/private subnets** for secure networking
* **Terraform** for provisioning
* **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD deployment automation

#### üß© Terraform Setup

1. Create your Terraform secrets in `terraform.tfvars` or use environment variables:

```hcl
region               = "ap-southeast-1"
aws_access_key_id    = "..."
aws_secret_access_key = "..."
rds_password         = "..."
django_secret_key    = "..."
vnpay_hash_secret_key = "..."
```

2. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
cd terraform/
terraform init
```

3. Validate and apply infrastructure:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan
```

> You can customize environment variables and image URLs in `variables.tf`.

- VNPAY is running in **sandbox mode** but enabled in production for now.
- Mock frontend using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to allow callback testing.
- Real production access requires official registration with VNPAY.
- For proper IPN (Instant Payment Notification) setup, refer to the VNPAY setup guide.
- After setting up the account, visit the following link to configure your IPN URL:
